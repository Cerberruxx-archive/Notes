## Algorithm concept clarification



***Computer algorithms*** are essentially just steps, or “instructions” needed to take for a computer for solve a problem. Noticed this as I thought about low-level languages (i.e. C) are procedural languages, operating sequentially to likely **mimic** the **way that most systems also likely process instructions (sequentially**). Connecting the different types of algorithms and methods I previously explored (e.g. Search and conquer).



The fact that computers use different algorithms for different types of tasks and problems, as one does not fit all (it would be ineffective for, say, sequential algorithms to be used for everything because not everything on a computer’s going to be easily solvable that way). Goes to the idea that the whole point of computers using different algorithms for the needed tasks is to execute tasks and solve problems as quickly and efficiently as possible, using the least amount of resources.



Computer algorithms are sequential by nature because the definition of an algorithm clearly states it as being a finite sequence of explicit instructions to solve a problem, and each step has to be followed in a specified order.

(Google AI) However, the term "sequential algorithm" is primarily used to contrast with other types of algorithms, as not all algorithms used in computing today are purely sequential.
