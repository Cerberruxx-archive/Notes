.NET significance to Powershell:
Powershell was built on the .NET platform and serves as a scripting interface for its underlying libraries and objects; everything within Powershell is a .NET object

Linux dotfiles: hidden configuration files for storing user-specific settings, preferences and customizations; in Unix-like systems, any file or directory name beginning with a dot is hidden by default
	-Primary purpose is for personalizing a user's environment without cluttering their home directory
	-Functions as a centralized way to manage configs for command-line tools, text editors, desktop environments and other utilities
	-examples: .bashrc, .zshrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig

registry (Windows): a central, hierarchical database for storing configuration settings and options, including:
	-OS data (kernal, services, etc)
	-user profile data (e.g.desktop themes, network settings, permissions)
	-apps (e.g. file location, version history, launch settings)
	-hardware config (e.g. drivers, properties, port usage)
	-file associations (links file type (e.g. .docx) to the programs that open them (e.g. Word)
	-Boot and performance (boot-up functions, system performance counters for profiling)
	
	Registry structure:
		Hives: Top-level categories (e.g. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CURRENT_USER)
		Keys and Subkeys: Folders that organize settings hierarchically
		Values: Actual data (e.g. text, numbers, binary) stored within keys

When do you not need to use pipelines with Powershell?
	-When the desired operation can be achieved with a single command (e.g. Clear-Host, Get-Help)
	-When the command produces output that doesn't need further processing before reaching its final destination (e.g. Where-Object, Get-Process -Name 'chrome')
	-Direct Variable Assignment
	-Note: Pipelines are tools for SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING, meaning that it's only required WITH SEQUENCE

Get-retrieves data
Set-modifies the properties of an object
Add-adds an item to a collection
Stop-stops a process or service
Start-starts a process or service
Clear-removes all items from a collection

common aliases:

Ls for Get-ChildItem
Gci for Get-ChildItem
Dir for Get-ChildItem
Gc for Get-Content
Rm for Remove-Item
Cd for Set-Location
Cls for Clear-Host


Parameters (the 'options' of a command) are marked with hyphens (-) before it

Get-Help followed by cmdlet name provides the syntax and brief info about other commands

Get-Command "_" lists all commands that have the contents inside the quotes

Get-Process -Name "_" retrieves information on the supplied process name inside the quotes

Get-Member used to understand the structure and capabilities of objects by listing their properties and methods

Where-Object serves as a filter for retrieved information; often used with Get-Process Command

Get-Service -Name "_" fetches Windows services

Start-Service -Name "_" starts a service; Stop-Service -Name "_" stops a service

Get-Eventlog or Get-WinEvent fetches event log entries with -LogName ""

Get-Content fetches content within a file, such as a plain text file

Set-Content or Add-Content allows you to write into files

Out-File sends output to a file;  commonly used for formatted output

New-Alias allows the user to create custom aliases and functions (e.g. New-Alias -Name p Value Get-Process)

Get-NetAdapterStatistics fetches stats of a specified network adapter with -Name "_"

Set-Location is basially CD. Use with -Path "_"

Copy-Item copies files from one directory to another

Start-Process runs files (e.g. EXE files)

Import-CSV -Path imports a csv file; Export-CSV -Path exports a csv file

ConvertTo-HTML converts a set of information to HTML format
ConvertTo-Json converts a set of info to JSON format

Test-Connection sends a ping to a defined remote host and checks whether it's reachable. Use the -Port parameter to check specific TCP ports

Resolve-DnsName -Name tests the name resolution of a computer to check whether a specific computer exists in your current network. Use -Type to query for a certain type of records such as A (Address), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME or MX (Mail Exchange)

Enable-PSRemoting enables Powershell remoting on a host
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName connects to the remote host
Exit-PSSession exits the session

Invoke-Command runs a command non-interactively on a remote host
New-PSSession establishes a persistent session for repeated operations

Get-ExecutionPolicy verifies the current policy

Set-ExecutionPolicy sets the policy. Use -Scope to specify the scope as well.

Get-Acl -Path retrieves the ACL (Access Control List) for a file
Set-Acl -Path sets the ACL for a file

New-SelfSignedCertificate creates a self-signed certificate
Set-AuthenticodeSignature is used to apply digital signatures to a script or file. Use options -Type, -Subject, CertStoreLocation as needed.
Get-AuthenticodeSignature checks the signature for a file

ConvertTo-SecureString creates a secure string of characters for a password or other sensitive data, then stores it into a file. Save the secure string to a file using a pipe followed by Out-File "C:\My-Path\Files"

Get-ComputerInfo retrieves detailed info about a computer's hardware, OS and config settings

Get-Host provides info about the current PS host environment. Useful for purposes such as debugging.

Get-WmiObject queries Windows Management Instrumentation objects; provides info about different system components and services

Note: To use functions after defined in a script, reference the name (e.g. ListAndCountFiles, ExecuteFollowingProcesses, etc.)
