Connection between computer algorithms and mathematical theory:

Algorithms are built upon mathematical theory, using concepts from discrete math (sets, graphs, logic) for design and analysis, and areas like linear algebra for graphics, providing formal frameworks (Turing machines) to define what can be computed. There is a two way relationship where math provides tools for computer science (e.g. calculus for AI, linear algebra for graphics) while algorithms help mathematicians complex concepts such as number theory and knot theory. - Google Search AI

In simple words: The main principles of computer science and algorithms are directly based upon mathematical theories and principles. For example, number sets, graphing and logic are use for things like system design and process analysis
Mathematical models are often also used to represent certain algorithmic concepts (see 'linear programming' (LP) in 'ComputerAlgorithms'). 


Role of Automata theory in computational theory:

Automata theory focuses on studying abstract machines to determine the capabilities and limitations of computation by analyzing mathematical models of HOW machines can perform the calculations.

In other words: It provides the basis for understanding how machines process inputs and produce outputs; includes key components:

Finite automata: Used to model simple systems like lexical analyzers in compilers

Pushdown automata: A more powerful model capable of recognizing context-free languages, essential for parsing programming languages

Turing machines: The most powerful automata, used as a standard for defining a problem's computability


Difference between conductors and semiconductors:
Electron mobility; conductors have a "sea of electrons" always available, while semiconductors require energy (heat, light, doping) to free up electrons to conduct, acting as switches.
In other words: Conductors are "always on" (high conductivity) for current, while semiconductors act like controllable switches (turn on or off).

How to dispose of toxic computer hardware waste:
Use certified e-waste recyclers (e.g. Staples, Best Buy) or manufacturer take-back options.
Before recycling, wipe all personal data from hard drives or physically destroy the drive to protect privacy. Remove any removable batteries (especially lithium-ion) and recycle them separately to prevent a fire risk.

Differences between hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs):
Hard Drives (HDDs) use spinning platters and moving arms for storage, making them slower, noisier, and less durable but cheaper with higher capacities; SSDs (Solid-State Drives) use flash memory, resulting in significantly faster speeds (boot-ups, load times), greater durability, lower power use, and silent operation, though typically at a higher cost for the same capacity. 

Microprocessors explained:
A microprocessor is a tiny, powerful integrated circuit (IC) chip that acts as the "brain" of a computer, combining the essential functions of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) like arithmetic, logic, and control into a single component, handling instructions and data to perform tasks in devices from smartphones to supercomputers.
They take binary data as input, process it according to stored instructions and provides binary output, enabling complex operations on a small silicon chip.

Microprocessors vs. Microcontrollers:
Microprocessors are essentially a tiny CPU that needs external memory and peripherals to function, while microcontrollers are basically an entire (albeit small) computer on a chip that integrates a microprocessor, memory and I/O peripherals together, which is also why they're often used in embedded systems like appliances and cars.

I/O (input/output) device explained:
A computer hardware component that allows computers to exchange data with other hosts/networks, by enabling communication between the system and its user, or another device.
In other words, it's how a computer receives information (input) and presents results (output).
Common I/O devices: printers, hard disks, keyboards, mice.

Is there a different between I/O devices and peripherals?
Yes, though there's significant overlap.
Peripherals are a broader category for any external hardware device (input, output and storage devices), which *explicitly* includes I/O devices.
Every I/O device is a peripheral but not all peripherals are strictly I/O (e.g. a simple storage-only device)

What is a kernel?
A program located at the core of an OS, that basically has complete control over everything in the system, managing hardware and software while acting as a bridge for physical components (e.g. CPU, memory, devices) and the system's applications.
The OS can't exist without a kernel because it completes essential tasks like hardware interaction, resource and process management, and security.

What is GNU/Linux?
GNU is a list of programs (provided by the GNU project) that create a bare-bones  OS when installed via the Linux kernel.
To clarify, Linux itself is technically the kernel; the 'heart' of the OS.
GNU provides the software and stuff it needs to be a WORKING OS.
**To note: the GNU utilities and kernel often aren't really enough, which is why other distros like Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, etc. bundle various other software as well as a default GUI, audio servers, and more. 
**Linux/GNU is essentially like MS-DOS, while the distros are like Windows 7 or 10 (referring to the addition of the GUI over time)

What is resource and process management on a CPU?
Resource management includes the allocation of CPU time, memory and peripherals across different programs.
Process management refers to how applications will multitask and schedules, starts and stops applications.

What is an interpreter?
Interpreters are the opposite of compilers; they translate and execute high-level code to machine language *line-by-line*, whereas compilers translate high-level code to machine code *all at once*.
It's a lot easier to catch and debug errors because of how it's read line-by-line, although compilers report all the errors after the entire run process is done.

What does 'BLOB' refer to?
It stands for 'Binary Large Object' and is a data type that stores multimedia files that are too large to be saved in any other type of data field.

Define 'endianness'.
A term referring to the order that a computer arranges bytes in its memory.
Big-endian (BE) stores the most important byte first (least to greatest); Little-endian (LE) stores the least important byte first (greatest to least).
This is to transport and store bytes in a memory address.

Why does a program only count as an algorithm when it's a finite loop?
Finiteness is a requirement of an algorithm.
Explaining further, if a program runs infinitely, it fails its purpose of producing a result, making it a 'process' rather than an 'algorithm' (which is supposed to eventually end to output a certain result).
If the process never ends then the result is never delivered.

How does memory hierarchy work with computer storage?
It organizes storage in layers, from CPU registers (fastest, smallest) down to disks (slowest and largest), which is done to keep frequently used data close to the CPU for quick access and least used data to the RAM for caching.

What is a bus?
A high-speed communication system that transfers data between either components inside a computer or between computers.
Acts as a 'digital highway.
*For example, a motherboard's internal bus connects core components of the PCB to internal storage.

Explain high-speed vs. low-speed peripherals.
High-speed peripherals transfer large data amounts quickly while low-speed peripherals send small amounts of data at lower speeds.
*Graphics cards, fast storage like SSDs, and high-res cameras are all high-speed peripherals.
*Keyboards, mice, joysticks and real-time clocks are low-speed peripherals.

What is lambda calculus and what relation does it have to computational models?
Lambda calc is a system for studying computation based purely from functions, with its core concepts being variables, abstraction, functions and application.
It's also a model equivalent to the Turing machine.

Is calculus and physics directly related to things like computational models and computational theory?
Yes, because calculus describes continuously changing systems (e.g. motion, electromagnetism) as physics provide the reasons why those systems occur. Calculus can apply to things like gradient descent or graphics algorithms; Physics can apply to physical simulations (like games) or fluid dynamics.

What is an Assembly language?
Any low-level programming language like ARM, x86 (for Intel/AMD) and MIPS. They use certain mneumonic instructions such as ADD or MOV.
**C is NOT considered an Assembly language because of how it's general-purpose and can be used at the low or high level; ASM (Assembly) languages are specific to a certain computer architecture.
**C also provides a layer of abstract over specific details of CPU hardware while ASM is MUCH more direct, with near identical syntax between the mneumonic code and actual binary code. C referred to as "portable assembly".
