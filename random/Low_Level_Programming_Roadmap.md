Absolutely — if you prefer to explore freely and let concepts connect on their own, here’s a clean, comprehensive list of **all the major low‑level programming topics** I mentioned earlier, plus a few closely related ones that naturally fit the same ecosystem.

I’m grouping them so you can dip into whatever catches your curiosity without committing to a sequence.

- Static vs dynamic linking

---

# 🔍 **Reverse Engineering & Malware‑Adjacent Topics**
- Disassembly  
- Decompilation  
- Binary analysis  
- Understanding shellcode  
- Memory forensics  
- Classic malware techniques (non‑harmful study only)  
- Anti‑debugging concepts  
- Packing/unpacking executables

---

# 🛠️ **Systems‑Level Projects & Concepts**
- Writing a simple shell  
- Building a tiny bootloader  
- Creating a memory allocator  
- Implementing a basic file parser  
- Writing a hex viewer/dumper  
- Building a disassembler  
- Implementing a simple virtual machine  
- Text‑mode UI rendering (fits your DOS aesthetic)

---

# 🔌 **Embedded & Low‑Level Electronics**
- GPIO control  
- Timers  
- Interrupt service routines  
- UART/SPI/I2C  
- Bare‑metal C on microcontrollers  
- Flash memory layout

---

# 🧠 **How Software Maps to Hardware**
- How C translates to assembly  
- How assembly becomes machine code  
- Stack frames  
- ABI (Application Binary Interface)  
- Undefined behavior in C  
- Optimization and compiler flags

---

# 🗂️ **Supporting Knowledge**
- Hexadecimal & binary  
- Bitwise operations  
- Memory alignment  
- Endianness  
- Static vs dynamic memory  
- Build systems (Make, CMake)  
- Terminal/console control sequences  
- Character encodings (UTF‑8, CP437 — very relevant to your ASCII art work)

---

# 🎮 **Retro & DOS‑Relevant Topics (your sweet spot)**
- Real‑mode x86  
- BIOS interrupts (INT 10h, INT 21h, etc.)  
- DOS memory model  
- COM file structure  
- VGA text mode  
- ANSI escape codes  
- Terminal emulation quirks  
- CP437 character set  
- DOSBox/QEMU environments

---

If you want, I can also turn this into:
- a printable checklist  
- a “pick‑three‑topics” starter guide  
- a branching map showing how topics relate  
- or a curated list based on your current DOS‑style VN project  

Just tell me what format helps you explore most naturally.
