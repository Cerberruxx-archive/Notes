#Learning Tip (12-24-25)

Instead of focusing on all the features of a certain topic, aim for "The Foundations", or main ideas.
For example, for Linux and Windows system admin, master your understanding of:

1. Permission: Who can read/write/execute a file?
2. Networking: How data moves from A to B (IPs, Ports, DNS, etc.)
3. Processes: What is currently running? What resources (CPU/RAM) is it eating?
4. Logging: Where does the computer document and "hide" the issue it ran into? (Event Viewer in Windows, /var/log in Linux)


**Hacking is actually System Administration done in reverse. To break something, you have to know how to make it first.**

#How to build a "mental encyclopedia":
*Step 1: Observing/Questioning. Every time you notice a file extension, process, etc. you don't recognize, don't Google. Just acknowledge it.
*Step 2: Recognition. Seeing a file multiple times until you remember it again.
*Step 3: Knowledge Storing. Understanding the idea from seeing it multiple times in the same context(s).

**"It's not about memorizing a dictionary; it's about understanding the language.**
