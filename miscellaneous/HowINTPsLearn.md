## How INTPs learn

Effective Study Strategies:

- **Connect & Question**: Constantly ask "how," "why," and "what if" to build mental scaffolds, noting questions on paper edges.
- **Create Systems**: Systematize information by mapping out connections, like drawing diagrams or writing down etymology to add context.
- **Apply Knowledge**: Research real-world applications to make abstract concepts tangible.
- **Vary Perspectives**: Seek different viewpoints, even if group work is challenging, to deepen understanding.
- **Minimize Distractions**: Create a focused environment, potentially by removing choices to avoid dopamine-driven distractions.

## What Hinders INTP Learning:
- Rote memorization or **repetitive** tasks.
- **Trivial material** that doesn't deepen understanding.
- Rigid, overly structured group work or lectures without **flexibility**.
- Information presented without **logical flow**
